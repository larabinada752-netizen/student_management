# Student Management System

This is a small project I built using Python and MySQL.
The goal is to manage students in an easy and fast way: I can add, view, update, and delete students directly from the database.
Everything runs from the Terminal or VS Code terminal, and I tried it myself.

##  Features

- View all students in the database.
